## Hi, wassup?
We are a team of 3 people. We write code, sometimes good, sometimes bad. We try to do some AI stuff, some non-AI stuff and sometimes some usefull stuff.
Welcome to our Github page.

We don't have a designer in our team and we don't plan to spend any time on graphics. That's why our avatar looks like that. In the other hand, our projects are certainly made better, than that.

Sometime in the future you will see projects we made. Not now, thought, as we haven't made any projects yet. 
How intruguing, I know. What will our first project be? Did I write the word 'intriguing' correctly? What a wonderful world full of questions.
