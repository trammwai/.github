## Hi, wassup?
We are a team of 3 people. We write code, sometimes good, sometimes bad. We try to do some AI stuff, some non-AI stuff and sometimes some usefull stuff.
Welcome to our Github page.

Sometime in the future you will see projects we made. Not now, thought, as we haven't made any projects yet. 
How intruguing, I know. What will our first project be? Did I write the word 'intriguing' correctly? What a wonderful world full of questions.
